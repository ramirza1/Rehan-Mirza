If you knew me in my HKS days, you may remember me as “a writer”. I took most courses the school had to offer on the subject – Writing on Policy and Politics, Op-Ed Writing, Feature Writing and Speechwriting – and even started up a student group dedicated to the practice. Of course, to be a writer, you actually have to write. Regularly. Outside of when professional necessity impels, I have been sadly slacking on that front since graduation. So I guess this blog is a commitment device, a container for thoughts that drives them forward towards better writing (forgive the mixed metaphors). In short, I need to get the reps in.

I’ll briefly share why I got into writing in the first place. Part of it comes from not being the best vocal communicator. I have a naturally quiet and a mind that runs faster than my mouth – when answer a question, I’ll have at least two answers in my head, debating which one to put forward, or how to reconcile them. By the time I start speaking, my mouth will still be catching up with my brain, and the words often come out as an uncertain, overly complicated mess. Especially when I’m nervous.

I’ve always found it easier to express myself through writing. It gives me time to gather those thoughts. On the page, my words can have the weight that uptalk won’t undermine. In short, I can express myself in a way that’s both informed and authoritative.

The King’s Speech is one of my favorite films, and one scene has always stuck with me. King George VI, struggling with insecurity about his stammer and speaking ability, is being goaded by his speech coach, Lionel Logue. Logue challenges him to explain why anyone should listen to him. Eventually, the King exclaims: “Because I have a voice!”

Writing gives me my voice. Give me a long-form essay question over a presentation or interview any day.

I believe in growth, and I recognize the importance of speaking too. If King George VI could overcome his stammer to address millions of Britons during war time, surely I can handle a conference room of 20. If I have to stumble through a hundred presentations or shaky interviews to become a more confident speaker, I’ll put in the work. But I think writing is where I can achieve the greatest success in communicating my worth. It’s a big part in me gravitating towards a research career. So if you have also have a strength that you’re maybe not fully using, lean into it!

I hope I can use this space for all sorts of things. Here’s what came out of an initial braindump:

- **Research and related work** which are formulated well enough to communicate, but not quite polished enough publish. Think of them like comedians having ‘skitlets’ that they never quite got round to converting into skits
- **Reflections on grad school life**. For someone starting up a blog, I’m actually quite a private person, especially when it comes to other people’s stories. So expect this to be more thematic than going into the detailed day-to-day interactions.
- **Guidance** for those thinking of doing a PhD, or some of the other stuff I’m doing or have done in the past. I enjoy mentoring people where I can, or answering random questions on Reddit, so hopefully this blog is another outlet for that
- **More creative writing**. I want to dabble outside of the analytical writing that has become my bread and butter. One of the most rewarding things I wrote at HKS was a personal essay, and it was super fun to write. I expect it will make my tech and policy-focused writing more engaging too

If you’re reading this, I appreciate you! If you’re not (aha), that’s also fine. My focus currently is just to write, even if the audience is an audience of one (me).
